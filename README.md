# agentikk-data-science - Hacklytics 2025 with DS club @ GT

Our project focuses on building an AI-based multi agent system that, given a dataset, will perform exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, validation and testing, followed by insight generation. Each of the individual tasks will be taken care of by separate AI Agents. 

The agents have been designed with system prompts with the potential of giving user prompts in future for more accurate results.
